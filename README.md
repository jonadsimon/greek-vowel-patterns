# greek-vowel-patterns

Modern Greek contains multiple phonome sounds which can be written in different ways ([single-letter vowels](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Greek_Language/Vowels), [double-letter vowels](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Greek_Language/Two-letter_Vowels)). In particular:
1. "ee" can be written 6 ways: ι, η, υ, ει, οι, υι
2. "eh" can be written 2 ways: ε, αι
3. "oh" can be written 2 ways: ο, ω

This repository finds patterns in the occurrences of these otherwise indistinguishable vowel sounds, which will hopefully be of help to first-time Greek language learners.
